# How to Join Mastodon From the Web

Like [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter) and [Threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threads_(social_network)), [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) is a [microblogging](/docs/glossary/microblogging) [platform](/docs/glossary/platform), allowing you to [post](/docs/glossary/post) short text [articles](/docs/glossary/article) that typically omit the need to include a title.

Since Mastodon is a [software](/docs/glossary/software), and not a [service](/docs/glossary/service), the general idea is for you to join a [social network](/docs/glossary/social-network.md) that *uses* Mastodon as the software that will give you a social networking and microblogging experience.

That said, if you are specifically looking for a social networking platform that *uses* Mastodon, then you will first need to find a [server](/docs/glossary/server) to join.

## Finding a server

Short of being encouraged to join a specific server that is running a Mastodon [instance](/docs/glossary/instance), you will first need to find a server to join.

Mastodon's website has a list of servers that are currently running, along with other information to describe what the server is, why it exists, and who is the intended [audience](/docs/glossary/audience).
