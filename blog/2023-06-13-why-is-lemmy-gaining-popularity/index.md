With the new API pricing [announced](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/2023apiupdates) by [Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reddit&oldid=1160000942), apps like [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apollo_(app)&oldid=1159994335)—a third-party Reddit client [^1]—has now been slated to shut down on June 30th, due the financial infeasibility of allowing users to continue using it. Users and moderators—who are often managing communities for free—have gone on a site-wide protest against changes introduced, among other reasons.

As reports of an exodus from Reddit unfolds, the software [^2], [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/), has been gaining popularity. In fact at the time of writing this, Lemmy has grown to become the [fifth most popular software](https://atomicpoet.org/notice/AWen4ZNYsSXqWZE9q4) on the Fediverse[^3].

## What is Lemmy?

According to the official Lemmy website:

> Lemmy is a selfhosted social link aggregation and discussion platform. It is completely free and open, and not controlled by any company. This means that there is no advertising, tracking, or secret algorithms. Content is organized into communities, so it is easy to subscribe to topics that you are interested in, and ignore others. Voting is used to bring the most interesting items to the top.

In other words, Lemmy brings Reddit-like features to the Fediverse.

With support for [WebFinger](https://webfinger.net/) and [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/), users of Mastodon, Calckey, Pleroma, or any other ActivityPub and WebFinger software can easily follow Lemmy users.

A feature that Lemmy has, that Mastodon does not, are "groups".

## Joining groups from platforms that don't support groups

Not on Lemmy, and hesitant to join it, but would still want to join a group?

There's good news.

Mastodon, Calckey, etc. are all implementations of ActivityPub, and because ActivityPub has the concept of an actor, and actors can follow other actors, a user can follow a group!

Following a group has a very similar procedure to <a href="/docs/getting-started/following-people">following a user</a>.
