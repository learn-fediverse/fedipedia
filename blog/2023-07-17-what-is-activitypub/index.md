When using [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), you are under no requirement to join the suggested [flagship](/docs/glossary/fagship) `mastodon.social` [server](/docs/glossary/server). You are free to join any other server that *[host](/docs/glossary/host)* Mastodon.

Further, you don't even have to sign up for a server that even uses Mastodon. You can sign up for any server that either uses Calckey, Frendica, Pleroma, Akkoma, Misskey, /kbin, Lemmy, or any other [social media](/docs/glossary/social-media) and [social networking](/docs/glossary/social-network) [platform](/docs/glossary/platform) that uses something called [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#target=_blank), and additionally [WebFinger](https://webfinger.net/#target=_blank).

With ActivityPub, as long as you know the [account address](/docs/specifications/account-address) of a particular [user](/docs/glossary/user), then you can interact with that user, even if they are not on the same server as you are on.

This is the power of [federation](/docs/glossary/federation).

It's not anything unique. This idea has been around since at least as far back as the invention of [email](/docs/glossary/email).

ActivityPub is the [protocol](/docs/glossary/protocol) that allows one user from one server to interact with another user from entirely different server.

This is totally contrary to what has traditionally been done; previously, when you signed up for a social media [service](/docs/glossary/service), and you wante to get in touch with a friend, that friend had have also signed up for the service, otherwise the two of you will need to find an alternative arrangement.

ActivityPub—along with WebFinger—changes all of that.
