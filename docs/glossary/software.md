# Software

The word "software" refers to a set of operating intstructions for a computer [^1], or many of these sets of instructions running either sequentially, or in parallel, to instruct the computer to perform tasks that are expected to operat.

As far as the [Fediverse](/docs/glossary/fediverse) is concerned, a software is the [implementation](/docs/glossary/implementation) of certain Fediverse [protocols](/docs/glossary/protocol).

[Accounts](/docs/glossary/account) on the Fediverse are all managed by the software that are hosted on a [server](/docs/glossary/account) on the Internet.

Although each software does its best to implement the expected Fediverse protocols, the protocols themselves, however, leave a lot flexibility to implementers, and hence why the Fediverse has so many software options to choose from.

Each of software have features that others don't, and intentionally omit features that others do implement.

Case in point: while [Mastodon](/docs/software/server/mastodon) enables you to post text content, [Pixelfed](/docs/software/server/pixelfed) *only* allows you to post photos. The reason being is that Pixelfed's intended audience is those who only intend to post and view photos to and from other members of the Fediverse.

[^1]: Instructions don't need to exclusively run on a computer. Other software can also be programmed to take in instructions. An example would be web browsers; they are programmed to take in instructions in the form either [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) or [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly). Another example of software that is capable of taking in instructions are [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine), that are capable of emulating a [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) and peripherals.
