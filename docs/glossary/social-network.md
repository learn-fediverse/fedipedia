# Social Network

Tracing the [relationships](/docs/glossary/relationship) among a set of individuals—or even organizations—forms a [social](/docs/glossary/social) [network](/docs/glossary/network). Some social networks can be drawn as an undirected [graph](/docs/glossary/graph) (e.g. "friends" and "acquaintances").

In the context of the [Internet](/docs/glossary/internet), a social network is a collection of [accounts](/docs/glossary/account) that are connected to each other (usually with one account following another).
