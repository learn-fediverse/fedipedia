# Social Network

Tracing the [relationships](/docs/glossary/relationship) among a set of individuals—or even organizations—forms a [social](/docs/glossary/social) [network](/docs/glossary/network). Some social networks can be drawn as an undirected [graph](/docs/glossary/graph) (e.g. "friends" and "acquaintances"), while others are strictly directed (e.g. "[followers]" and "following"; in these examples, a user doesn't follow all followers, if any).

In the context of the [Internet](/docs/glossary/internet), a social network is a collection of [accounts](/docs/glossary/account) that are connected to each other (usually with one account following another).

The term "social network" is often verbified as "social networking", which describes the act of an individual or organization attempting to expand their social network, typically by acquiring more friends and acquaintances.
