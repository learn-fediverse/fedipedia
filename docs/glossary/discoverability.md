# Discoverability

Discoverability refers to the ease with which users can find and access relevant [content](/docs/glossary/content). It focuses on ensuring that [users](/docs/glossary/user) can easily locate and navigate through the [system](/docs/glossary/system)'s content.

Discoverability doesn't exclusively need to be an active search for content; it could also be the result of passive browsing, resulting in adjacent content being presented to the user.
