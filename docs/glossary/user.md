# User

A user is referring to any entity interacting with [software](/docs/glossary/software) (or hardware).

In the context of the [Fediverse](/docs/glossary/fediverse), a user does not need to be an account. An account is owned by a user, but not all users own accounts.

Some users just [lurking](/docs/glossary/lurking), without ever interacting with anyone.
