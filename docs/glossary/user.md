# User

A user is referring to any entity [interacting](/docs/glossary/interaction) with [software](/docs/glossary/software) (or hardware).

In the context of the [social media](/docs/glossary/social-media), a user does not need to be an [account](/docs/glossary/account). An account is owned by a user, but not all users own accounts.

Some users just [lurk](/docs/glossary/lurking), without ever creating any account; they merely [browse](/docs/glossary/browsing) the [public](/docs/glossary/public) [content](/docs/glossary/content) as published on the [platform](/docs/glossary/platform).
