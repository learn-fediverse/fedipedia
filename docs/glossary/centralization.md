# Centralization

Centralization refers to the concentration or consolidation of [data](/docs/glossary/data), resources, control, or [services](/docs/tech/glossary/service) within a single [system](/docs/glossary/system), [server](/docs/glossary/server), or [entity](/docs/glossary/entity). It involves the idea of having a central authority or central point of control that manages and governs various aspects of a technological infrastructure.

Various central authorities exist on the Internet. One specific example is the [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#target=_blank), where there is only a handful of root name servers responsible for providing the [authoritative name servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server#Authoritative_name_server) for top-level domains.

Another example of centralization is the [certificate authorities](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-certificate-authority/#target=_blank) that are responsible issuing digital certificates that are used to secure a website, by authenticating it, and ensuring privacy.

Another example of centralization are the central [BitTorrent trackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker) that are intended to help a computer locate other peers, so that the computer can then become a peer in the peer-to-peer [network](/docs/glossary/network).

More ostesible examples of centralized services are [Instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram#target=_blank) and [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#target=_blank). Neither Instagram nor Twitter can interact with each other, and no user can directly communicate, without an individual or organization being forced to create an account on both platforms.
