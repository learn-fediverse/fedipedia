# Self-Hosting

When an [application](/docs/glossary/application) is self-hosted, it means that all or parts of a particular [instance](/docs/glossary/instance) of a [software](/docs/glossary/software) is maintained by a user of the said software, as opposed to by the entity that initially created it.

For example, when you download a copy of the [Mastodon](/docs/software/server/mastodon) software, upload it to a [server](/docs/glossary/server), go through the initial setup (including registering a [domain name](/docs/tech/glossary/domain-name.md)), you are engaging in the act of "self-hosting" the Mastodon server.

On the other hand, if you don't intend to go through the trouble of hosting a Mastodon instance yourself, you can instead use [Mastodon](/docs/software/server/mastodon)'s [flagship](/docs/glossary/flagship) instance, and you therefore are **not** engaging in self-hosting.
