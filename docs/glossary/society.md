# Society

A society is a complex [network](/docs/glossary/network) of individuals who share a common geographic territory or a cohesive [group](/docs/glossary/group) with shared values, beliefs, norms, and practices. It is a [system](/docs/glossary/system) in which people interact, cooperate, and organize themselves to fulfill their needs and achieve common goals.

In a society, individuals are [interconnected](/docs/glossary/interconnection) through various social [relationships](/docs/glossary/relationship), such as family, friendships, communities, and institutions. These relationships form the basis for [social](/docs/glossary/social) [interaction](/docs/glossary/interaction), cooperation, and the development of social structures and institutions like government, education systems, economies, and legal systems.

Societies are characterized by their [cultural](/docs/glossary/culture), economic, and political systems, which influence how individuals live, work, [communicate](/docs/glossary/communication), and interact with one another. They can vary greatly in terms of their organization, size, complexity, and values, ranging from small, traditional societies to large, modern, and diverse ones.

Societies also have social norms, which are shared expectations and rules about appropriate behavior, values, and beliefs. These norms help regulate social interactions, maintain order, and ensure the smooth functioning of the society.

Overall, a society is a dynamic and evolving [entity](/docs/glossary/entity) that reflects the collective behavior, aspirations, and achievements of its members. It shapes individuals and, in turn, is shaped by them through their actions, choices, and contributions.
