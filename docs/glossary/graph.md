# Graph

A graph is an abstract structure containing objects (typically called "[nodes](/docs/glossary/node)"), and each object can have one or many [connections](/docs/glossary/connection) (typically called "[edges](/docs/glossary/edge-graph-theory)") to other nodes.

These connections could either be one-way, or two-way.

In a graph containing at least one one-way connection, the graph is said to be a "directed graph". Where as in a graph containing nothing but two-way connections, the graph is said to be an "undirected graph".

For example, in a [social network](/docs/glossary/social-network) where every [relationship](/docs/glossary/relationship) is a "friendship", the social network forms an undirected graph. Facebook and LinkedIn (had they never implemented the concept of a "[follower](/docs/glossary/follower)") are examples of social networks that form an undirected graph.

In another example, a social networks that has the concept of followers‚but not "friends"—any graph that results from this social network is not guaranteed to be an undirected graph.
