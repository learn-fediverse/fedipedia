# Decentralization

Decentralization is an umbrella term for a class of [network](/docs/glossary/network) structures that have each [node](/docs/glossary/node) operate independently, yet—in many instances—manage to achieve a common goal.

Decentralization lies in stark contrast to [centralization](/docs/glossary/centralization), where each node is governed by a central authority to ensure that each node is aligned in accordance to the standards as maintained by the central authority.

[Entities](/docs/glossary/entity) that [connect](/docs/glossary/connection) to a decentralized network do not need to exclusively utilize it. Rather, a decentralized network is merely a tool used to attain a goal.

For example, on the [Fediverse](/docs/glossary/fediverse), two [accounts](/docs/glossary/account) don't need to reside on the same [service](/docs/glossary/service) in order to [communicate](/docs/glossary/communication) with each other. In the instance that both accounts reside on different services, they may still [interact](/docs/glossary/interaction) with each other, since both service providers use a commonly agreed-upon suite of protocols—those being ActivityPub and WebFinger—in order to relay messages from one account on one [server](/docs/glossary/server), to another another account on another server.

In the above example, even though neither servers are dependent on a central authority to coordinate distribution of messages from server to server, they are still dependent on the [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#target=_blank)—a [centralized](/docs/glossary/centralization) system—to find the destination server where the recipient accounts resides.
