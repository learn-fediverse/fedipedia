# Hyperlink

A hyperlink, often referred to simply as a [link](/docs/glossary/link), is a reference or a [connection](/docs/glossary/connection) between two separate pieces of [information](/docs/glossary/information) or [web pages](/docs/glossary/web-page) on the internet. It allows users to navigate and access different web pages by clicking on the linked text or image.

Hyperlinks are an essential element of the World Wide Web and are used to connect web pages, websites, and various online resources. They enable users to move from one page to another, even if the pages are hosted on different websites or servers.

Hyperlinks are typically displayed as underlined or differently colored text, although they can also be represented as images or buttons. When a user clicks on a hyperlink, their web browser sends a request to the linked URL (Uniform Resource Locator), and the destination page is loaded, allowing the user to access the content associated with that link.
