# Edge (Graph Theory)

An edge in graph theory is what would colloquially be called a "[connection](/docs/glossary/connection)", "[relationship](/docs/glossary/relationship)", or "[link](/docs/glossary/link)". In other words, it is a more formal term to describe what relates or links two [nodes](/docs/glossary/node) together.

That said, graph theorists do prefer to distinguish the notion of an "edge" and a "connection"â€”or "link" or "relationship".

In graph theory, edges are typically represented as a [tuple](/docs/glossary/tuple), with the first element representing the originating node, and the second element representing the destination node.

For bi-directional edges, we will have two separate tuples to specifically represent that single bi-directional edge.
