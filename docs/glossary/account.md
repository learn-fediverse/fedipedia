# Account

Broadly speaking, an account refers to a record or representation of a person, organization, or [entity](/docs/glossary/entity)'s financial or non-financial transactions and activities.

As far as [social media](/docs/glossary/social-media) is concerned, an account is an [entity](/docs/glossary/entity) that [posts](/docs/glossary/post) [content](/docs/glossary/content), [follows](/docs/glossary/follow) accounts, and have other accounts follow them.

On some [social media](/docs/glossary/social-media) [platforms](/docs/glossary/platform), entities don't need to be a person; they could be just about anything that has access to an account.
