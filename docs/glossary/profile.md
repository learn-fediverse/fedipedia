# Profile

A profile typically refers to a description or representation of an entity (an individual, organization, etc.). It contains relevant information about the entity, often highlighting key characteristics, attributes, or details.

In the context of [social media](/docs/glossary/social-media), a profile can also disseminate additional information auto-generated by the [system](/docs/glossary/system) that [hosts](/docs/glossary/host) the profile; typically this information is the direct result of activities that the associated [account](/docs/glossary/account) has engaged in, e.g. posting [content](/docs/glossary/content).

For example, [browsing](/docs/glossary/browsing) a profile may not only display their name, profile picture, any websites that they linked, but also all posts that they created can be displayed in a chronological [timeline](/docs/glossary/timeline).
