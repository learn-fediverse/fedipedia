# Fediverse

The Fediverse is a [network](/docs/glossary/network) of [social networking](/docs/glossary/social-network) [platforms](/docs/glossary/platform) that connect to each other.

[Accounts](/docs/glossary/account) from one smaller social network (specifically in a [server](/docs/glossary/server)) is capable of interacting with an account from another totally distinct social network.

The concept that one [service](/docs/tech/glossary/service) (such as a social networking site) is capable of interacting with other services that serve similar intents is known as [federation](/docs/glossary/federation). Hence the name "fediverse", which is a portmanteau of the words "federated" and "universe", thus "federated universe", or more compactly "fediverse".
