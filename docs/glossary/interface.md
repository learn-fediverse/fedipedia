# Interface

An interface refers to a point of interaction or communication between two or more systems, entities, or components. It defines how different parts of a system or different systems can connect and exchange information or perform actions.

Interfaces serve as a boundary between different parts of a system, allowing them to work together without needing to know the internal details of each other. They provide a standardized way for different components or systems to communicate, enabling interoperability, modularity, and abstraction.

Interfaces can take various forms, depending on the context. They can be graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow users to interact with software through visual elements like buttons and menus. They can also be application programming interfaces (APIs) that provide a set of functions or protocols for software developers to utilize when building applications or integrating systems.

Overall, interfaces play a crucial role in enabling communication, integration, and cooperation between different software components, systems, or even between humans and machines.
