# Federation

Federation refers to a [network](/docs/glossary/network) of independent [entities](/docs/glossary/entity) that co-operate to provide a common [service](/docs/glossary/service). In a federated [system](/docs/glossary/system), each entity maintains control over its own operations and resources, but also agrees to abide by certain common protocols or standards to enable collaboration and interoperability. Federation can involve the establishment of a central coordinating authority that sets rules, standards, and protocols for the participating entities.

An example of federation is [email](/docs/glossary/email).

Each email provider is their own independent service, each operating under commonly agreed-upon set of procedures in order to allow its [users](/docs/glossary/user) to send messages to users of other entirely independent email service providers.

This runs counter to a more [centralized](/docs/glossary/centralization) system, where if a person desires to communicate with another person, both will need to hold [accounts](/docs/glossary/account) under the same service.
