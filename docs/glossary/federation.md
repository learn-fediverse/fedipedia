# Federation

Federation refers to a [network](/docs/glossary/network) of independent [entities](/docs/glossary/entity) that co-operate to provide a common [service](/docs/tech/glossary/service). In a federated [system](/docs/glossary/system), each entity maintains control over its own operations and resources, but also agrees to abide by certain common protocols or standards to enable collaboration and interoperability.

An example of federation is [email](/docs/glossary/email).

Each email provider is its own independent service, but each operating under commonly agreed-upon set of procedures in order to allow its [users](/docs/glossary/user) to send messages to users of other entirely independent email service providers.

Another more ostensible example of federation is the Fediverse, more specifically, [software](/docs/glossary/software) that are compatible with [WebFinger](https://webfinger.net/#target=_blank) and [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub#target=_blank).

This runs counter to a more [centralized](/docs/glossary/centralization) system, where if a person desires to communicate with another person, both will need to hold [accounts](/docs/glossary/account) under the same service.
