# Timeline

The "timeline" on a [social media](/docs/glossary/social-media) [software](/docs/glossary/software.md) is the view of all [posts](/docs/glossary/post) that you[^1] have received.

<!-- TODO: include images of what the timeline looks like -->

[^1]: By "you", I'm referring to entity that is currently logged in to its account, and viewing the timeline.
