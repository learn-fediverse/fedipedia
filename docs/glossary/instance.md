# Instance

An instance on the [Fediverse](/docs/glossary/fediverse) refers to a running copy of a version of a piece of [software](/docs/glossary/software) on some [server](/docs/glossary/server).

The Fediverse is comprised of [accounts](/docs/glossary/account), and software often must exist in order for these accounts to do anything at all, be it accept followers, accept [content](/docs/glossary/content), push content upon request of the account holder, etc.

Anyone could write Fediverse software, but that is rather highly time consuming.

Instead, people opt to download existing software, and create a running instance of it on some server.
