# Service (Software)

On the [Internet](/docs/glossary/internet), a service refers to a specific function or capability provided by a [server](/docs/glossary/server), computer system, or software application. It can be thought of as a piece of functionality that is made available to users or other programs over a network, typically the internet. Services can vary widely in their nature and purpose, ranging from simple tasks like email, file sharing, and instant messaging to complex services like cloud computing, online banking, and social media platforms.

Internet services often rely on a client-server model, where the service provider (server) hosts and manages the service, and the users or client applications access and utilize the service remotely. The service provider handles the underlying infrastructure, maintenance, and data management required to deliver the service to the users.
