# Follow

When an [account](/docs/glossary/account) owned by (for example) Alice follows an account owned by Bob, the account owned by Alice will automatically receive [content](/docs/glossary/content) from Bob, whenever Bob [posts](/docs/glossary/post) content on their own account.

On the [Fediverse](/docs/glossary/fediverse), if you know the [address](/docs/specifications/account-address) of a particular account, you can request to follow the account on the address, from the [server](/docs/glossary/server) that you are signed up in, even if the account you are attempting to follow is on a different server.

:::tip New to the Fediverse?

If you don't know much about how to work with the Fediverse, then you'd definitely appreciate following the [Getting Started](/docs/category/getting-started) guide, which will walk you through not only signing up for an account, but also how to follow people on the Fediverse.
