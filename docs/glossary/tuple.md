# Tuple

A tuple is a finite ordered sequence of objects. For example, the combination of a *first name* and a *last name* can be considered a tuple, since, it has a finite number of objects—two, to be exact—and is an ordered sequence—if you are supplied two strings, you know the first is the "first name" and the second is the "last name".
