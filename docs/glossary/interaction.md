# Interaction

Interaction refers to the reciprocal action or influence between two or more entities, where they affect or communicate with each other. It involves a dynamic process in which the actions, behaviors, or reactions of one entity elicit responses or changes in the other entities involved.

Interactions can occur in various contexts, including human-human, human-computer, or even between different elements in a system.
