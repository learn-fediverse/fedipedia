# Post

## Noun

A post is a piece of [content](/docs/glossary/content) created by an [account](/docs/glossary/account) on a [social media](/docs/glossary/social-media) [platform](/docs/glossary/platform).

The word "posts" and "content" is often used interchangeably, but content is more broad and general.

A post is an actual piece of content that can be identified and/or located using some unique identifier/locator, and many "posts" can be created. The idea of "content", on the other hand, is more broad. Content could refer to a profile picture. But, a profile picture is often not a post that an account sends. A profile picture is often just a unique attribute of an account, and only one profile picture can be retrieved.

So in short, an account can have multiple posts, but a piece of content is not exclusively a post.

## Verb

To post a piece of content means to perform an action on a social media platform that could result in the creation of a post, on said platform.
