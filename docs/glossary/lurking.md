# Lurking

A [user](/docs/glossary/user) is said to be lurking if they primarily browse the [content](/docs/glossary/content) of a site, with minimal—if any—interaction with the site itself.

The term "lurking" is sometimes used to describe people who never [post](/docs/glossary/post), but may occasionally [press the like button](/docs/glossary/reaction) on a post, or even [repost](/docs/glossary/repost) content. But more often, a "lurker" is someone who only reads the publicly-available content of a site.
