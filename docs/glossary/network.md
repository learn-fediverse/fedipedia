# Network

Broadly speaking, a "network" refers to a [system](/docs/glossary/system) or structure comprised of interconnected elements or nodes. These elements can be various [entities](/docs/glossary/entity.md) such as computers, devices, people, organizations, or any other objects that are connected together to exchange [information](/docs/glossary/information), resources, or services.

Ignoring any context, and focusing solely on the nodes and connections is called a [graph](/docs/glossary/graph).
