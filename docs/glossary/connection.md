# Connection

A connection is a joining two or more things together.

This term is often interchangeably used with [relationship](/docs/glossary/relationship) or [link](/docs/glossary/link).

That said, ideally the term "connection" should mostly be used to describe the *action* of forming a relationship or link. For example, two [nodes](/docs/glossary/node) in the process of establishing a [communication](/docs/glossary/communication) link would be a connection.
