# Host

A host is an [entity](/docs/glossary/entity) that acts as a trustee to receive and store resources from another entity who is the provider of said resource. Depending on the policy agreed upon between the host and the provider, the host may dissiminate the resource either ad verbatim, or by computing it (usually computing a computer program).

In the context of the [Internet](/docs/glossary/internet), a host is typically a [server](/docs/glossary/server) that holds data (which could include computer programs) that its user has given to it, and who would then publish the data either via [the Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web#target=_blank), or via some [API](/docs/tech/glossary/api).

## As a verb

The word "host" is often verbified to mean that an entity acts as the host.
