# Boost

To boost a [post](/docs/glossary/post) means to ["repost"](/docs/glossary/repost) a post onto the [timeline](/docs/glossary/timeline) of your followers.

Because "boosting" literally means "reposting", those two words are almost used interchangeably.

The only difference being that on many [social media](/docs/glossary/social-media) [platforms](/docs/glossary/platform), the [user](/docs/glossary/user) is unable to modify the post before boosting it onto their followers' timeline.

A "repost" on the other hand does not require any specific features from a social media platform; only posting either a copy, screenshot, or even "boosting" will suffice in order for that post to be considered "reposted".
