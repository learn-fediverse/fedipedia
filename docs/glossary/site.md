# Site

A site is any [service](/docs/glossary/service) that is accessible via a [web browser](/docs/software/misc/web-browser).

In the context of the [Fediverse](/docs/glossary/fediverse), a site is almost synonymous with "[server](/docs/glossary/server)", with one caveat being that a site represents *intent*.

While a server represents a physical (or virtual) machine hosting a [software](/docs/glossary/software) that is managing [Fediverse](/docs/glossary/fediverse) [accounts](/docs/glossary/account), a site represents what most accounts on that server/site is mostly intending to do on there.

There are sites dedicated to users talking about data visualization (e.g. [vis.social](https://vis.social)), others are tech related (e.g. [techhub.social](https://techhub.social)).

That said, because of the distinction between "server" and "site" are so nitpicky, most people use the term "site" and "server" interchangeably.
