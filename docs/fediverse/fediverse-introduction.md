# What is the Fediverse?

From the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fediverse&oldid=1159459130):

> The fediverse (a portmanteau of "federation" and "universe") is an ensemble of federated (i.e. interconnected) servers that are used for web publishing (i.e. social networking, microblogging, blogging, or websites) and file hosting, which, while independently hosted, can communicate with each other.
