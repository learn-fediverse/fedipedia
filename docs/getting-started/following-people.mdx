# 2. Following People

Like Twitter and Facebook, you can follow people on the [Fediverse](/docs/glossary/fediverse).

But but what's even better than Twitter and Facebook, is that you can follow anyone from any [site](/docs/glossary/site) that is on the Fediverse, without having to sign up for the server.

			<h3>Following accounts on the same server</h3>

				Let's say you are on <code>calckey.social</code> for your Fediverse
				account. You can follow someone just by clicking the follow button.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's take{" "}
				<a href="https://calckey.social/@kainoa">
					Kainoa (@kainoa@calckey.social)
				</a>
				, for example, the founder of Calckey.
			</p>
			<p>Their account is on calckey.social, and so is our example account.</p>
			<p>
				I could simply go to https://calckey.social/@kainoa, to follow them.

			<h3>Following accounts on different servers</h3>
			<p>
				Let's say you are on <code>calckey.social</code> but you happened to
				have stumbled upon the other account of Kainoa{" "}
				<a href="https://chaos.social/@leah">
					ThatOneCalculator (@thatonecalculator@stop.voring.me)
				</a>
				. The follow button will be missing.
			</p>
			<p>Fortunately, you don't need to create any new accounts, whatsoever!</p>
			<p>
				You would copy the address from either the address bar, and paste it
				into the search bar of the server that you are signed up for.

				You would copy the address from either the address bar, or the link that
