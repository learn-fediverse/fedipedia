# Following People

Like Twitter and Facebook, you can follow people on the Fediverse.

But but what's even better than Twitter and Facebook, is that you can follow anyone from any site that is on the Fediverse, without having to sign up for the server.

:::tip Am I required to sign up?

You are *not* required to sign up to a server, if you already have a fediverse account somewhere else.

When you are asked to sign up when attempting to follow, you simply copy the link from the address bar, and paste it in the search bar of the server that you are actually signed up to.
