# Signing Up

The fediverse is like email. No one owns it. You just create an account on any server that you like, and it doesn't matter where you do; someone from one server can follow someone from an entirely different server. Just sign up, and you should be able to follow people from anywhere on the fediverse.

There are several options available to you. Here are a few that have been hand-picked for your convenience.

## Some Servers

That said, pleae do consider looking up all other Fediverse servers that are currently available.

Here are some excellent resources for you to explore:

- [fedi.garden, a servers list that you can filter through](https://fedi.garden/)
- [fediverse.party, themed servers list](https://fediverse.party/en/portal/servers/)

:::note Note

It's generally frowned upon for articles to only introduce a small list of fediverse servers.

That said, the vast majority of people reading this list are probably only familiar with Facebook or Twitter, etc., where it was your friends pushing you to join either one or the other, or both.

On the fediverse, however, you wouldn't have friends pushing for Calckey Social, then another pushing for Mastodon Social, and then being forced to create an account on both; your friend will tell you to get any fediverse account, and follow them using whatever account that you signed up for. No need to sign up for all fediverse sites.

Again, the fediverse is a lot like email. A Hotmail account can send an email to a Gmail account.
