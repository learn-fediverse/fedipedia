# Signing Up

The [Fediverse](/docs/glossary/fediverse) is a lot like email. No one owns it. You just sign up for an [account](/docs/glossary/account) on any [server](/docs/glossary/server) that you prefer. Someone from one server can follow someone from an entirely different server. Just sign up, and you should be able to follow people from anywhere on the fediverse.

The accounts that you follow on a different server does not even need to use the same [software](/docs/glossary/software).

There are several options available to you. Here are a few that have been hand-picked for your convenience.

Also, please do consider looking up all other Fediverse servers that are currently available.

Here are some excellent resources for you to explore:

- [fedi.garden, a servers list that you can filter through](https://fedi.garden/)
- [fediverse.party, themed servers list](https://fediverse.party/en/portal/servers/)

:::tip You read that right

A Fediverse account on mastodon.social is able to follow a Fediverse account on calckey.social, even though they are two different servers, running on two different software.

This is totally unlike Twitter and Facebook, where a Twitter account is unable to follow Facebook account, and neither a Facebook account is able to follow a Twitter account.

This will work for any account that exposes a [WebFinger](https://webfinger.net/) endpoint, and properly implements the [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ActivityPub&oldid=1158665469) specification.

:::note Note

It's generally frowned upon for articles to only introduce a small list of fediverse servers.

That said, this article is aimed towards those migrating away from Facebook and Twitter, and thus also likely to not yet be acquainted to the Fediverse. It's probably best to start people off with having them explore a handful of Fediverse servers, and hope readers are curious enough to continue exploring further. Again [fedi.garden](https://fedi.garden/) and [fediverse.party](https://fediverse.party/en/portal/servers/) are a few good resources to help identify some servers that users may feel at home.
