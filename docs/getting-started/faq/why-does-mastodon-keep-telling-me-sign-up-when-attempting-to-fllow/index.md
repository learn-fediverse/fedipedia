# Why does Mastodon keep asking me to sign up, when attempting to follow someone?

**TL;DR: You are under no obligation to sign up for another Mastodon account just to follow another account. To follow someone when asked to sign up, you can alternatively just type in the account's address on your home server, and you should be able to find the account and follow it.**

So someone sent you a URL to their Mastodon profile.

You click the follow button, but you are presented with a pop-up that asks you to sign up. You think to yourself: "why do I need to sign up?"

The good news is, you don't; you are under no obligation to sign up for that server.

So it is incorrect that Mastodon requires you to sign up.

You can simply follow someone, as long as you know their account address.

Once you know their account address, you can go to your home server, and enter in the user's account address.

Once you found the profile that you are looking for, you can simply follow the profile, just as if they were located on the same server you are.
