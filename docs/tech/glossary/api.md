# Application Programming Interface (API)

An [application](/docs/glossary/application) programming [interface](/docs/glossary/interface) (or API, for short), is a set of methods by which an application can [interact](/docs/glossary/interaction) with another application, or to retrieve [information](/docs/glossary/information).

An API can be comprised of any [medium](/docs/glossary/medium) that the [application developer](/docs/glossary/software-developer) has employed in order to grant other applications access to it.

In the case of the [Fediverse](/docs/glossary/fediverse), a lot of [software](/docs/glossary/software) may grant access to other software via a set of [HTTP](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/) endpoints.
