# Domain Name

A domain name is a string of human-readable characters used to uniquely identify a [service](/docs/tech/glossary/service) on the [Internet](/docs/glossary/internet).

A domain name is part of a larger hierarchical system called the [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#target=_blank), which translates the human-readable domain name into the numerical IP address that computers use to communicate with each other.
