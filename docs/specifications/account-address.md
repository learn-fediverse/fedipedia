# Account Address

If you want to [follow](/docs/glossary/follow) a friend on the [Fediverse](/docs/glossary/fediverse), the guaranteed method to be able to follow them is to know their [account](/docs/glossary/account) address, and using it to follow them from the [server](/docs/glossary/server) that you are on.

The account address format looks like this:

```
@<your username>@<your server domain name>
```
